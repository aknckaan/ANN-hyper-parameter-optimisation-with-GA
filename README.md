# ANN-hyper-parameter-optimisation-with-GA
A genetic algorithm (GA) designed to optimise the hyper parameters of an neural network as well as evolving its structure.
The algorithm supports steady state GA and Generational GA.
Cassification and regression, minimisation and maximisation options are added.
Algorithm favours inovations and protect inovators for 5 generations. This feature increases the diversity of the population.
Roulette wheel selection is used.
